## Welcome to the *Simple**FOC**project* :tada:

This is a community project that aims to demystify Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithm for the larger public by creating a robust but simple to use implementation of it in the Arduino IDE: Arduino *Simple**FOC**library*

The library has a goal to support:
- as many **motor + position sensor + current sense + driver + microcontroller** combinations as possible.
- as many BLDC and Stepper motor control techniques possible
